### A Note from the Developer: Mahmudul Hasan

``` I am pleased to present my first completed project developed during my journey in learning Kotlin: Learn To Build a Timer. As a budding developer, I am deeply grateful for the invaluable support I received from various online communities throughout this endeavor. While I cannot individually express my appreciation to everyone, I extend my heartfelt thanks to the incredible communities on Github, Discord, and Reddit's android-dev forum. Their guidance and assistance played a pivotal role in bringing this project to fruition.

Looking ahead, I remain enthusiastic about actively engaging with these communities, not only seeking guidance but also aspiring to contribute to their ongoing projects in the future. I welcome any constructive feedback on my work, regardless of its nature, as it serves as a valuable learning opportunity for me.

While I am dedicated to continuously honing my skills and expanding my knowledge, I acknowledge the limitations of my current hardware, which can sometimes pose challenges while working in Android Studio. Nevertheless, I remain resolute in my pursuit of growth and development.

I sincerely hope that this project serves as an inspiration and resource for fellow learners. May we all continue to embark on this shared journey of exploration and discovery in the realm of development.

Thank you for your time and consideration.
